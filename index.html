                put millions of children at risk. Every year they leave vast devastation and damage in these areas, and

                <p class="acknowledgement-speech">Donate Today is the conception of a brilliant idea that introduces
                    more transparency in donations and better equips both parties in giving and receiving aid in a more
                    effective manner.

                <p class="acknowledgement-speech">It has been a privilege to be associated with DonateKart from their
                    initial days of establishment. Sphoorti shares a great rapport with the Founders of DonateKart -
                    Sandeep and Anil. We have had the good fortune of running 6 successful campaigns with DonateKart
                    till date. Our donors are very happy that they can now send donations in-kind to our children. We
                    look forward to growing deeper and stronger relationship with DonateKart.

                <p class="acknowledgement-speech">I wanted to help the people in my hometown. I was reluctant to donate
                    money. DonateKart allowed me to donate different products and ensured that it got to the needy in my
                    hometown. Being away from the country, this platform made it possible to make the donation with
                    utmost ease.
